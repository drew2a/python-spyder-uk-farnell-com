1. Using the BeautifulSoup

I have used BeautifulSoup because I didn't find an easy way to get a text from an HTML block with all children, using Scrapy.
I needed this functionality while parsing "Legislation and Environmental"
In css words: ('#pdpSection_ProductLegislation > div.collapsable-content > dl> dt') and
              ('#pdpSection_ProductLegislation > div.collapsable-content > dl> dd')
